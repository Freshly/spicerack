## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).

### Adding a New Spicerack Gem

To add a new gem to the spicerack:

```
cd spicerack
bundle gem GEM
cd GEM
rm -rf .git
rm .travis.yml
rm .gitignore
chmod 0664 lib/GEM/version.rb
```

Here's a checklist of some other tasks (see another gem as reference):

⚠️ Reminder: Add the magic comment to the top of all the generated ruby files!

- Delete `Gemfile`
- Create a `CHANGELOG.md` and make the first entry
- Edit `lib/GEM/version.rb` to add the comment line
- Edit `README.md` to add badges, update development & contributor sections, generate ToC
- Edit `./Rakefile` to add GEM to the `SPICERACK_GEMS` constant
- Copy over `GEM/Rakefile` from any other gem
- Remove the failing spec in `spec/GEM_spec.rb` and replace it with the rspice shared example
- Edit `spec/spec_helper.rb` to use the shared spec helper
- Edit `GEM.gemspec` and clean up the boilerplate

Then in the base directory:

- Add a require for your new gem into `lib/spicerack.rb`
- Add the new gem into `spicerack.gemspec`
- Increment the version in `SPICERACK_VERSION`
- Run `rake spicerack:update_all_versions` to the correct version

Next, push the code up and open a new pull request.

Once that gets merged into master, run:

- Run `rake spicerack:release_all` to claim the new gem name with the empty build

🚨 Don't forget to run `bundle` so the `Gemfile.lock` gets updated!!

### Release

💁‍ Please remember to keep all the `CHANGELOGS` up to date!

This is a monorepo which contains several gems designed to build and release together.

To perform release, set the new canonical version in the .4.4`SPICERACK_VERSION` file then run the task.

```ruby
echo "0.1.0" > SPICERACK_VERSION
rake spicerack:update_all_versions
git commit -am "Updating to version 0.1.0 for release"
rake spicerack:release_all
```

This will build and release all dependent gems at the same time.

Only the master branch should be released!

### Versions

Spicerack uses `Major.Minor.Patch` version control.

Versions should be increased according to the following rules:

- *Major Version* for non-backwards compatible changes.
- *Minor Version* for new gems or important features.
- *Patch Version* for bug fixes, enhancements, and optimizations.
